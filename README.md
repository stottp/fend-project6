# Map of Crimes in England and Wales
Allows you to enter a location in England and Wales and get a list of crimes committed in that area

## Getting Started
Open this link https://stottp.github.io/fend-project6/index.html. The page defaults to a town called Telford in England and shows all the crimes committed for a particular month. The dropdown hides a list of crimes until a value is selected.

## Using the App
Search for a location in England or Wales and then you will see a map of all the crimes committed. You can then filter the type of crimes by selecting a crime category from the dropdown. This will then produce a list of crimes under this category and if you click on a list item, it will highlight on the map where the crime was committed.
